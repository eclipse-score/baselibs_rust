## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-score/baselibs_rust.git
cd baselibs_rust
```

### 2️⃣ Build the Examples of module

> DISCLAIMER: Depending what module implements, it's possible that different
> configuration flags needs to be set on command line.

To build all targets of the module the following command can be used:

```sh
bazel build //src/...
```

This command will instruct Bazel to build all targets that are under Bazel
package `src/`. The ideal solution is to provide single target that builds
artifacts, for example:

```sh
bazel build //src/<module_name>:release_artifacts
```

where `:release_artifacts` is filegroup target that collects all release
artifacts of the module.

> NOTE: This is just proposal, the final decision is on module maintainer how
> the module code needs to be built.

### 3️⃣ Run Tests

```sh
bazel test //tests/...
```

## Clippy

- Clippy runs by default via `.bazelrc` when building Rust targets (rules_lint aspect).
- Use `bazel build //src/...` (or any Rust target pattern) while developing.
- Use `bazel build --config=lint //src/...` to enable lint config, including `--@aspect_rules_lint//lint:fail_on_violation=true`.
- The Clippy config comes from `@score_rust_policies//clippy/strict:clippy.toml`.

## 🛠 Tools & Linters

**Tools and linters** from **centralized repositories** are integrated to ensure consistency across projects.

- **Rust:** `clippy`, `rustfmt`, `Rust Unit Tests`
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated builds and tests

---

## 📖 Documentation

- A **centralized docs structure** is planned.
